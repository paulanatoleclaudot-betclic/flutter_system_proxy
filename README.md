# Flutter System Proxy

A Flutter Plugin to detect System proxy. When using HTTP client that are not proxy aware this plugin can help with finding the proxy from system settings which then can be used with HTTP Client to make a successful request.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Add `flutter_system_proxy` to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_system_proxy: ^0.3.0
```

Then run:

```sh
flutter pub get
```

Alternatively, install from the command line:

```sh
flutter pub add flutter_system_proxy
```

### iOS requirements

On iOS this plugin ships as a Swift Package only — it no longer provides a
podspec. Your app must therefore use Swift Package Manager for its iOS
dependencies:

- Flutter 3.44.0 or newer.
- Swift Package Manager enabled: `flutter config --enable-swift-package-manager`
  (on by default since Flutter 3.44).

If your app's `ios/` directory still has a `Podfile`, migrate it first:

```sh
cd ios
pod deintegrate
rm Podfile Podfile.lock
```

Then remove the `#include? ".../Pods-Runner.*.xcconfig"` lines from
`ios/Flutter/Debug.xcconfig` and `ios/Flutter/Release.xcconfig`, and drop the
`Pods/Pods.xcodeproj` file reference from `ios/Runner.xcworkspace`. See
[Flutter's Swift Package Manager docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-app-developers)
for details.

If you cannot migrate off CocoaPods yet, pin to `flutter_system_proxy: ^0.2.2`.

### Basic Usage (Example With Dio)

```dart
import 'package:flutter_system_proxy/flutter_system_proxy.dart';


...


var dio = new Dio();
var url = "http://....";
var proxy = await FlutterSystemProxy.findProxyFromEnvironment(url);
(dio.httpClientAdapter as DefaultHttpClientAdapter).onHttpClientCreate =
   (HttpClient client) {
      client.findProxy = (uri) {
        return proxy;
   };
};
var response = await dio.get(url);
```

### Advanced Usage (Custom Dio Adapter)

```dart

// Create a custom adapter that can help resolve proxy based on urls 
// (This is important as in some senerio there are PAC files which might have different proxy based on different urls)
class MyAdapter extends HttpClientAdapter {
  final DefaultHttpClientAdapter _adapter = DefaultHttpClientAdapter();

  @override
  Future<ResponseBody> fetch(RequestOptions options,
      Stream<Uint8List>? requestStream, Future? cancelFuture) async {
    var uri = options.uri;
    var proxy =
        await FlutterSystemProxy.findProxyFromEnvironment(uri.toString()); // This line does the magic
    _adapter.onHttpClientCreate = (HttpClient clinet) {
      clinet.findProxy = (uri) {
        return proxy;
      };
    };
    return _adapter.fetch(options, requestStream, cancelFuture);
  }

  @override
  void close({bool force = false}) {
    _adapter.close(force: force);
  }
}

// Use a wrapper around getting dio
void getDio(){
  var dio = Dio();
  dio.httpClientAdapter = MyAdapter();
  return dio;
}

```
